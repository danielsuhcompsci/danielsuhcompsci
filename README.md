# Hello, I'm Daniel 👋

I'm a passionate undergrad in computer science seeking internship opportunities to further develop my skills and contribute to exciting projects. I have a strong foundation in full-stack development and a growing interest in machine learning.

## 👤 About Me

- 🌐 Full-Stack Developer: Proficient in technologies like HTML/CSS, Typescript, React, Node, NextJS, Docker, and AWS.
- 💼 Campus Involvement: Actively engaged with two prominent organizations:

    - 🪐 **Nebula Labs**: Collaborating with a talented team on the "Jupiter" project. Using tools like Jira, NextJS, and GitHub, we aim to enhance the UTD student experience by making a unified platform for student organization discovery and engagement.

    - 🔬 **ACM Research**: Advised by Dr. Murat Kantarcioglu, working with team of 5 to develop a model for precise steganography detection in JPEG images, using CNNs and support vector machines.

## 🌱 Interests

- 🤖 Machine Learning: I'm currently captivated by the limitless possibilities of computer vision and large language models.
- 🦀 Rust Enthusiast: Excited about Rust's unique borrow checking capabilities and its potential to make systems safer and more robust.
